        <p><b>Travel can be stressful, for a lot of reasons. But some stress can be preempted. Whenever you leave the house for more than a few days, you should do these things:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Turn off the water to all toilets. You never know what they'll do while you're gone</b></li>
            <li><b>Keep your toothbrush and toothpaste in your carry-on. If your suitcase gets lost, your mouth feels it first.</b></li>
            <li><b>Clean everything, so that no one can enjoy it while you're gone.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>If you have any ideas you'd like to add to this list, share them in the comments section below!</b></p>
