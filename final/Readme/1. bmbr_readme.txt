Final faculty review 05/04/2018 (may the fourth be with you)
The following will be addressed sometime in the summer of 2018... after graduation and after I officiate my little sisters wedding... maybe after I take a vacation... I will also be trying to get this going up and live

Instead of name delete_R use name = delete_(primaryKey); when you autogenerate the delete resource form... Server side....

About us page (Rather than "suggested courses at the bottom...)

Professors nav bad?? (faculty) <-- Want the word Faculty rather than Professor...

switch research topics with research "news" (lab suite news/ molecular suite new )

FAQ instead of pdf have a link field for prof (so they can add a URL that is linkable for user)

switch prof login with faculty login 

List 
Get rid of Biochemistry... left with...
molec, genetics, bioinf, immune

Consider a Biology Degeree (not BMB)... link appropriatly

Get rid of "suggested Courses"

Consider major / scholarships / faqlink [hard code this q and a. get email from gingerich]

get rid of quotes and add tab name as title... for banner, no shouting "Welcome!"

I should also address the large BUGS.doc in this directory as well
