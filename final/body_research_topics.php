					<p>If you love biology and chemistry then biochemistry/molecular biology (B/MB) might be the major for you. B/MB involves the study of life processes at the molecular level. Students study how molecules such as DNA and proteins control our heredity, development, aging and mental activity, and how abnormalities in these molecules can lead to diseases such as cancer.</p>

					<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

               A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. 
               War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
               into infinity.

                    It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first

                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
                    power to destroy an entire planet.

                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
                    the stolen plans that can save her people and 
                    restore freedom to the galaxy...</p>
