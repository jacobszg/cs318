If you love biology and chemistry then biochemistry/molecular biology (B/MB) might be the major for you. B/MB involves the study of life processes at the molecular level. Students study how molecules such as DNA and proteins control our heredity, development, aging and mental activity, and how abnormalities in these molecules can lead to diseases such as cancer.
